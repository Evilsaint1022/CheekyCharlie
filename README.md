Welcome to **CheekyCharlie** — a modular Discord bot built as a fun hobby project!  
This bot is completely open-source to promote transparency and inspire others to create their own bots.

I got tired of relying on bots that constantly went offline or became unusable, so I decided to build a single, reliable Discord bot that combines many of the best features from popular free bots into one solution.

(This project uses dotdatabase made by NZ-Linix)
